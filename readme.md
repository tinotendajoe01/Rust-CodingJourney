<h1>Rust Algorithm Learning Path</h1>

<h3>A Personal Journey Through Rust Algorithms</h3>
</div>

This repository documents my personal journey in mastering algorithms in Rust. It's structured as a step-by-step learning path, with notes and simplified code breakdowns, ideal for those starting from the core concepts of Rust.

### Learning Order

1. **Math**: Basics of algorithmic logic.
2. **Data Structures**: Core for data manipulation.
3. **Sorting**: Fundamental data organization...
   ...
4. **General**: Miscellaneous algorithms.

### Inspiration and Reference

This learning journey is inspired by [TheAlgorithms/Rust](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Rust). The repository serves as a reference resource, providing a comprehensive view of algorithms implemented in Rust.

### Contributing

Feel free to contribute, suggest improvements, or share your learning experiences.

### List of Algorithms
