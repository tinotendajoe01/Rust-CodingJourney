# Rust Guessing Game

This simple guessing game is written in Rust. It generates a random number between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and prompts the user to guess the correct number. The user is provided with feedback on whether their guess is too small, too big, or correct.

## Basic Logic

1. **Welcome Message**: The program starts by printing a welcome message to the console using `println!`.

2. **Generate a Secret Number**: The `rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1..=100)` line generates a random number between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and stores it in the variable `secret_number`.

3. **Game Loop**: The `loop` keyword starts an infinite loop where the user can make multiple guesses until they guess the correct number.

4. **User Input**: The program prompts the user to input their guess using `println!`.

5. **Read User Input**: The user's input is read from the console using `io::stdin().read_line(&mut guess)` and stored in a mutable variable `guess`.

6. **Convert to Integer**: The user's input, initially a string, is converted to an unsigned 32-bit integer using `guess.trim().parse()`.

   - If the conversion is successful (`Ok(num)`), the parsed number is stored in the variable `guess`.
   - If there's an error (`Err(_)`), the program continues to the next iteration of the loop, ignoring the invalid input.

7. **Compare Guess with Secret Number**: The user's guess is compared with the secret number using a `match` statement and the `guess.cmp(&secret_number)` method.

   - If the guess is less than the secret number, the program prints "Too small!".
   - If the guess is greater than the secret number, the program prints "Too big!".
   - If the guess is equal to the secret number, the program prints "You win!" and breaks out of the loop.

8. **Repeat Loop**: The loop continues until the user guesses the correct number.

## Rust Syntax and Principles

### `::` (Double Colon)

In Rust, `::` is used to access items (functions, traits, types, etc.) defined within a module. For example:

```rust
use std::cmp::Ordering;
```
````

Here, `std` is a standard library module, and we're using `cmp` module inside it. `Ordering` is an enumeration (a set of named values) used for comparisons.

### `println!`

Rust uses macros for printing, and `println!` is one such macro. It prints a formatted string to the console. For example:

```rust
println!("Hello, {}!", "world");
```

This prints "Hello, world!" to the console. The `{}` is a placeholder that gets replaced by the provided value.

### `rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1..=100)`

- `rand::thread_rng()` gets a random number generator tied to the current thread.
- `gen_range(1..=100)` generates a random number between 1 and 100 (inclusive).

### `loop`

`loop` creates an infinite loop. It continues to execute until a `break` statement is encountered. For example:

```rust
let mut counter = 0;

loop {
    println!("Count: {}", counter);
    counter += 1;

    if counter == 5 {
        break;  // Exit the loop when counter reaches 5
    }
}
```

### `expect()`

Used for error handling. If something goes wrong, `expect()` is used to provide a custom error message and terminate the program. For instance:

```rust
let mut guess = String::new();

io::stdin().read_line(&mut guess).expect("Failed to read line");
```

If reading the line fails, the program will print "Failed to read line" and exit.

### `Ok(num)` and `Err(_)`:

- `Ok(num)`: Represents a successful result. The variable `num` holds the successful result.
- `Err(_)`: Represents an error. The underscore `_` is a placeholder for the specific error value.

For example:

```rust
let guess: u32 = match guess.trim().parse() {
    Ok(num) => num,
    Err(_) => continue,
};
```

If parsing the guess to a number is successful, it's stored in `guess`. If there's an error, the loop continues.

### `match`

`match` is used for pattern matching. It's like a fancy `if-else` but more powerful. For instance:

```rust
match guess.cmp(&secret_number) {
    Ordering::Less => println!("Too small!"),
    Ordering::Greater => println!("Too big!"),
    Ordering::Equal => {
        println!("You win!");
        break;
    }
}
```

Here, it checks if `guess` is less than, greater than, or equal to `secret_number`, and it performs different actions based on the result.

### `Ordering::Less`

`Ordering` is an enumeration that represents ordering relationships. `Ordering::Less` is one of its variants, indicating that one value is less than another. In our case, it means the user's guess is too small.

These concepts might seem a bit complex at first, but as you use them more in Rust, they become natural and powerful tools for expressing your program's logic.
