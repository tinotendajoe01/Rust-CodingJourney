This code is about a fast way to calculate big numbers like "2 raised to the power of 100" using a method called binary exponentiation. Imagine you want to know how many candies you get if you double your candies each day for 100 days. Instead of doubling day by day, binary exponentiation finds a quicker way by grouping the days together. It's like saying, instead of counting 1, 2, 3, 4..., you count 1, 2, 4, 8..., which reaches 100 faster. The code does this by breaking the power (like 100 days) into smaller parts (like groups of days) and then multiplying them together smartly and quickly.

Financial Forecasting System: Develop a tool to calculate the future value of investments using compound interest, considering different compounding intervals and durations. This will help in financial planning for health industry investments or patient payment plans.

E-Commerce Discount Engine: Create an algorithm to calculate bulk discounts for products. For instance, implementing a tiered pricing model where the discount rate exponentially increases with the quantity purchased.

Database Encryption Tool: Develop a system for secure data encryption in health databases using a simplified version of RSA encryption, which relies heavily on exponentiation of large numbers. This will be crucial for protecting sensitive patient data.
